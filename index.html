            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Slighty insane programmer type guy. Recent graduate from Falmout University where I did Computing for Games (CFG) which is a Bsc. I got a first which was neat.
                I currently work at a startup called <a href="https://keeled-moon.com/" target="_blank">Keeled-Moon</a> with some other graduates working on a game called <a href="https://nightmorn.com/" target="_blank">Nightmorn</a> Nightmorn. We have no money so we doing it on the side.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I specialise in Graphics Engine Programming, Tools and Application Infrastructure. A gameplay programming I can do but im not great at capturing feelings and don't enjoy it.
                By Application Infrastructure I mean things like game settings (graphics, audio, control rebinding), making sure the game has runtime lifecycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not programming I like to play Dungeons & Dragons or other TTRPGs with my friends, that or i'll be playing RimWorld, Baldur's Gate 3 train sim or War Thunder.
                Other downtime activities include electronics - I like to fix video cards that where on fire at some point :)
            </p>
            <p>
                I have train autism.

                <p>Has an in-frame compute shader pipeline which is used for some basic GPU-driven rendering technquies</p>
                <p>Since university I have added BepuPhysics engine library to it making it offically a game eninge (although it still has no UI)</p>

                <p>For this I reverse engineered a nerfgun and turned into a motion controller for aiming a gun in a mobile game where you shoot random targets</p>

                <p>I was lead programmer for this project and developed alot of the core gameplay systems and UI. Additionally I added Wiimote support to the game because it was fun and weird and the university where encouraging gimmicks</p>

                <p>I created a multi-threaded terrain generator with texture blending which could be modified in real-time. This was way overboard.</p>
